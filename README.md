# LatexProject
# Group project for CS3321

# Project Overview
- This project is written in C#, meaning that in order to run and compile the program you will need to use a Windows OS.
- The UI has three seperate tabs, with the main tab being the Latex Table Helper. On this tab there are many different buttons with tool tips that tell the user what they do.
- You can change cell color, font color, merge cells, split cells, font size, underline, bold, italicise, text alignment, etc. all with the built in UI.

# Project Directory Breakdown
- When looking at the project directory all of the code and its dependicies are in the root folder, as well as the TestLatex folder.
- Our UML diagrams, class diagram, and interaction diagram along with all of our images that we used for our buttons and UI are in the Docs folder, and its subsequent subfolders.
